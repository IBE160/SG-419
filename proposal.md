## Case Title
AI-Powered Exam Grader

## Background
Educational institutions are facing an ever-increasing volume of student submissions, placing a significant strain on examiners to provide timely, consistent, and high-quality feedback. The manual grading process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human subjectivity and inconsistency. This solution aims to leverage artificial intelligence to automate and augment the evaluation of student exams, filling the gap between the need for robust assessment and the logistical challenges of manual grading.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this application is to streamline and enhance the exam grading process. It will provide examiners with an AI-driven tool that automatically assesses student submissions against a predefined rubric, suggests grades, and generates detailed justifications for its evaluations. The system will solve the problems of grading inefficiency, inconsistency, and the long feedback loop for students, while also addressing critical ethical considerations by keeping the human examiner in control.

## Target Users
- **Examiners/Professors**: University professors and lecturers responsible for grading exams. Their primary goal is to assess student knowledge accurately and efficiently. Their technical proficiency varies, so the interface must be intuitive and require minimal training.
- **Administrative Staff**: Course coordinators or departmental administrators who manage the logistics of exams. They need to upload exam materials, monitor the grading process, and manage user access. They are generally proficient with administrative software.
- **Students**: The end-recipients of the grades and feedback. They will (optionally) interact with a student-facing portal to view their results and the AI's justification, helping them understand their performance. They are digital natives but require a clear and non-technical interface.

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- **Secure User Authentication**: Role-based access control (Examiner, Admin, Student) with strict security protocols.
- **Document Upload**: Admins can upload exam questions, official solution guidelines, and the grading rubric. Examiners can upload anonymized student submissions in batches.
- **AI Grading Engine**: The core engine processes each submission, compares it against the solution and rubric, scores it, and suggests a grade.
- **Justification Generation**: For each suggested grade, the AI provides a detailed explanation referencing specific parts of the student's submission and the rubric.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: The system flags submissions with a high degree of similarity to other submissions or known sources.
- **Examiner Review Interface**: A dashboard where examiners can view the AI's suggested grade, the justification, and the original submission side-by-side. 
- **Manual Override**: Examiners can accept, reject, or modify the suggested grade. All manual changes are logged for auditing purposes.

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- **Consistency Reporting**: The system analyzes a batch of graded exams and reports on the consistency of the AI's (and any human grader's) scoring.
- **Student Feedback Portal**: A secure portal where students can view their graded submission, the AI's feedback, and any additional comments from the examiner.
- **Calibration Dashboard**: An interface for administrators to fine-tune the AI's grading parameters, such as the weighting of different rubric criteria.
- **API for LMS Integration**: An API to allow integration with existing Learning Management Systems (e.g., Canvas, Moodle).

### Detailed Feature Specification
- **Feature Name**: AI Grading Engine
  - **State Machine**: 
    - `Pending`: Submission uploaded but not yet processed.
    - `Analyzing`: The AI is actively evaluating the submission against the rubric and solution guide.
    - `Graded`: The AI has produced a suggested grade and justification.
    - `Reviewing`: An examiner is actively viewing the AI-generated result.
    - `Accepted`: The examiner has accepted the AI's suggestion.
    - `Manually_Overridden`: The examiner has modified the AI's suggestion.
    - `Flagged`: The submission has been flagged for plagiarism or other anomalies requiring special attention.
  - **Data Structures**: 
    - `Submission {submission_id, student_id_anonymized, content, format}`
    - `Rubric {rubric_id, criteria: [{criterion_id, description, max_points, weight}]}`
    - `GradingResult {result_id, submission_id, suggested_grade, rubric_scores: [{criterion_id, score, justification}], plagiarism_flag: {is_flagged, score, suspected_sources}, final_grade, status}`
  - **Logic**: 
    1. The engine ingests the anonymized student submission and the corresponding exam's rubric/solution guide.
    2. It uses semantic analysis and pattern matching to compare the submission's content against each criterion in the rubric.
    3. For each criterion, it assigns a score and generates a text justification explaining how it arrived at that score, citing evidence from the submission.
    4. A plagiarism check is run concurrently, comparing the submission against the batch and a wider corpus.
    5. The final suggested grade is calculated based on the weighted sum of the rubric scores.
  - **Edge Cases**: 
    - **Illegible/Poorly Formatted Submissions**: The system will flag submissions that cannot be parsed correctly for manual review.
    - **Ambiguous Language**: If the AI cannot confidently interpret a student's answer, it will assign a lower confidence score to its suggestion and prompt the examiner for a closer look.
    - **Contradictory Information**: The engine will highlight contradictory statements within a submission.

## User Stories & Example Scenarios

### User Stories
1. As an **Examiner**, I want to upload a batch of anonymized exam papers, so that the system can start the grading process for me.
2. As an **Examiner**, I want to review a clear dashboard showing the AI's suggested grade and justification next to the student's work, so that I can make an informed final decision quickly.
3. As an **Examiner**, I want to override a suggested grade and provide my own feedback, so that I can handle nuanced cases the AI might miss.
4. As an **Administrator**, I want to securely manage user accounts and roles, so that only authorized personnel can access sensitive exam data.
5. As an **Administrator**, I want to define a detailed grading rubric and upload solution guides for each exam, so that the AI has a clear basis for its evaluation.
6. As a **Student**, I want to see a breakdown of my grade against the official rubric, so that I can understand my strengths and weaknesses.

### Example Scenario
Professor Hansen is facing a pile of 150 digital essays for her introductory ethics course. After logging into the AI Grading system, she creates a new "Final Exam" session. The department administrator has already uploaded the exam questions and a detailed rubric focusing on argumentation, use of sources, and ethical reasoning. Prof. Hansen uploads the 150 anonymized student essays as a single zip file. 

Within 30 minutes, the system notifies her that the initial grading is complete. She navigates to the review dashboard and sees the first student's paper. The AI suggests a grade of 'B' (85/100). In the justification panel, the AI has highlighted sections of the student's essay, commenting: "*Excellent use of Kantian ethics to support the main argument (Rubric C1: 5/5). However, the sourcing is weak and does not follow the required citation style (Rubric C2: 3/5). Plagiarism score is low (5%).*" Professor Hansen agrees with the assessment, clicks "Accept Grade," and moves to the next paper, which has been flagged for manual review due to ambiguous language.

## Technical Architecture

### Platform Type & Deployment
- **Platform**: Secure, multi-tenant Web Application.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Deployed to a GDPR-compliant cloud provider (e.g., AWS or Azure) using a containerized architecture (Docker, Kubernetes) to ensure scalability and security.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for a strongly-typed, modern UI. Chart.js for data visualizations on the admin dashboard. WebSockets for real-time progress updates.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, and robust security features. Libraries like spaCy and scikit-learn will be used for NLP pre-processing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for its robustness, reliability, and strong support for data integrity and JSONB for storing flexible rubric scores and justifications.

### AI Integration (If applicable)
- **LLM Provider/Model**: A private instance of a powerful model like OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude 3, hosted within a secure cloud environment (e.g., Azure OpenAI Service) to ensure data privacy and prevent data from being used for training.
- **Integration Strategy**: The backend will make secure API calls to the private LLM instance. System prompts will be engineered to instruct the AI to act as an examiner, providing the rubric, solution guide, and student submission. The AI will be asked to return a structured JSON object containing the grade, scores, and justifications.
- **Practical Concerns**: API costs will be managed by optimizing prompts and using efficient models. Rate limiting will be handled with exponential backoff. All LLM responses will be validated against a Pydantic schema before being stored or displayed. Error handling will be extensive to manage API timeouts or malformed responses.

- **PlagiarismFlag**: `id` (PK), `submission_id` (FK), `score` (FLOAT), `suspected_sources` (JSONB), `status` (e.g., 'Pending', 'Dismissed')

## System Parameters & Configuration
- **Plagiarism Sensitivity**: A threshold (e.g., 0-100) that determines when a submission is flagged for potential plagiarism.
- **Rubric Weighting**: Administrators can adjust the weight of each criterion in a rubric to influence the final grade calculation.
- **Anonymization Keys**: A secure, separate table mapping anonymized IDs back to real student IDs, accessible only by high-privilege administrators for final grade reporting.
- **LLM Model Selection**: Ability to choose between different AI models (e.g., 'speed-optimized' vs. 'accuracy-optimized') for grading.
- **LLM Temperature**: A setting (0.0-1.0) to control the randomness/creativity of the AI's justification text. Default will be low (e.g., 0.2) for consistency.

## Technical Constraints
- **Data Privacy & Security**: Must be fully compliant with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations. All student data must be anonymized during processing and encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **High Accuracy Requirement**: The AI's grading must have a very high correlation with human expert graders, verified during a mandatory calibration phase.
- **Auditability**: Every grading decision, whether made by the AI or a human, must be logged and auditable.
- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle hundreds of concurrent submissions during peak exam periods without a significant drop in performance.
- **Intuitive UI**: The user interface must be clean, simple, and require minimal training for non-technical users like professors.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- **Risk 1 (Ethical/Bias)**: The AI model may inherit biases from its training data, leading to unfair grading for certain demographics.
  - **Mitigation**: Use state-of-the-art models with bias-mitigation techniques. Conduct rigorous, transparent testing with diverse datasets. Always keep a human in the loop for final decisions and provide clear justifications for all AI suggestions.
- **Risk 2 (Technical/Security)**: A data breach could expose sensitive student information and exam materials.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement end-to-end encryption, strict role-based access control, regular security audits, and data anonymization by default. Host on a secure, compliant cloud infrastructure.
- **Risk 3 (Performance)**: High latency from the LLM API could make the grading process slow and frustrating.
  - **Mitigation**: Use asynchronous processing for all AI tasks. Implement a robust queueing system (e.g., Celery with Redis) to manage grading jobs. Provide real-time feedback to the user on the status of their request.
- **Risk 4 (Adoption)**: Examiners may not trust or want to use an AI grading tool.
  - **Mitigation**: Involve examiners in the design and testing process. Emphasize the tool's role as an assistant, not a replacement. Provide clear evidence of its accuracy and time-saving benefits through a pilot program.

## Related Work (Optional)
This project builds upon existing concepts in educational technology but carves a unique niche. While tools like Turnitin and Grammarly offer sophisticated plagiarism detection and writing assistance, they do not provide a holistic grading solution based on a complex, user-defined rubric. This project's novelty lies in its direct integration of advanced LLMs into the core assessment loop, treating the AI as a co-grader rather than just a text analysis tool. It aims to move beyond simple checks to a more nuanced, context-aware evaluation of student work.
